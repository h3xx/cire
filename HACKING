2: Submitting Code:

	All people interested in developing Cire should be
	using CVS, not releases, development happens
	in CVS, using Releases may cause compatibility errors.
	Please follow the this Checklist when submitting code:
	
	1: Make your Changes!
	2: ENSURE it compiles with the new code in, please.	
	3: Type "cvs diff -u > patchfile". Replace Patchfile with a more appropriate name.
	4: GZip or BZip your Patch.
	5: Send the Patch to the Cire-Develop Mailing List
	   (See http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cire-develop)
	6: The Patch will be evaluated by the Module Owner (See Section 3) and
	   The Community, and will be accepted or rejected.

3: File Management List:

	The Owner of the File you have changed is the one who will
	make the final Decision as to whether your patch will be accepted
	or Rejected, they have authority over their files, please do not argue
	with them about the Files. If you think your submission was unfairly
	rejected, you may contact Andrew, as he has overriding access.
	Know, however, that he will most often be on the Developer's side.

	Files labeled Anybody can be modified by 
	Any person on the Core Team, so submissions
	to those files will just be accepted/rejected by
	whatever Developer is interested.
