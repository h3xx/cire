Cire TODO

General
=======
- exporting to various formats:
	text: done
	html: Template Sent, Waiting on John
	sxw: this is going to suck, sort of.  There's meta-data to be
	     generated, plus we have to be able to transparently zip 5
	     files, 4 of which aren't really related to the diary
	     itself.  Probably a post-1.0 thing.
	rtf: ??
	TeX / LaTeX: done
- Signal handling?
- Better encryption (256 Bit AES, eh, Joe?)

Build
=====
- Make --with-debugging add -g to CFLAGS. I added in a --with-debugging statement
	that will make build_debug true or false, but I need code to act on the build_debug
	variable in configure.ac


Ncurses
=======
- More testing
- Tab completion (Ian suggested looking into 'readline' for this)
- Entry Viewer:
	- Allow Page up, Page down, Home, End

GTK
===
- Status bar?
- Search: core support is in place, just need to add gtk specific stuff.

Core (diary, entry, prefs)
