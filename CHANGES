Cire Version 0.14.0:

	2004-10-16 17:07  thestarz

		* Makefile.am: Andrew put a list of all source files in
		  /Makefile.am as well as /src/Makefile.am. I've fixed this.

	2004-10-14 19:40  andrewm1

		* README: Removed Periods from End of URL's

	2004-10-14 15:39  andrewm1

		* CREDITS, HACKING, README, TODO, configure.ac: - Added Tom Davis
		  To CREDITS

		  - Updated HACKING for new Autotools Stuff

		  - README *really* needed updating

		  - Added some Template stuff for a --with-debugging in
		  configure.ac,     see TODO for more intop. If it gets in, I'll
		  add the option to the list	     in INSTALL.

		  - To Conform with Automake, I was considering asking the SF
		  People to   rename CHANGES to ChangeLog and CREDITS to AUTHORS,
		  what	      do other people think?

		  First of All, I added in the Autotools system by John. This, in
		  essence, has completely reorganized the code and made the
		  intallation much nicer.

		  Also, I added Id Tags to all files... Hopefully, it shall all
		  work :-)

		  I think we have enough changes in here for the next version...
		  Perhaps... Ah well, we'll discuss it.

		* src/: gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h: Applied Tom's
		  patch adding search support to the gtk interface. Sorry it took
		  so long, I kind forgot about it...

		* CREDITS:

		  New Credits Format!

	2004-04-14 12:59  thestarz

		* TODO, src/misc.c, src/misc.h, src/ncurses_ui.c: Search is now not
		  case sensetive. For some reason though, searching for a string of
		  less than four characters doesn't seem to work. If anybody can
		  figure out why, let me know.

			  John

	2004-04-13 12:55  thestarz

		* TODO, src/diary.c, src/diary.h, src/ncurses_ui.c,
		  src/ncurses_ui.h: Applied Ian's patch for exporting to LaTeX.
		  Good code Ian, however in some places you had spaces instead of
		  tabs for indentation. Try to avoid that ;)

			  John

	2004-04-12 19:37  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c: The search prompt in the text viewer no
		  longer displays the list of entries instead of the text being
		  view. I changed nci_get_user_text to not update the main part of
		  the screen any more. This, however, led to the problem of the
		  screen being messed up if the term is resized while a text prompt
		  is open. To solve this I made it clear the main part of the
		  screen if, and only if, the term is resized.

		  I also made some changed to TODO. Take a look.

			  John

	2004-04-11 20:00  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c: Added search support to the ncurses text
		  (entry) viewer.

			  John

	2004-04-11 12:53  thestarz

		* src/: diary.c, entry.c, main.c, main.h, misc.c, ncurses_ui.c,
		  ncurses_ui.h: Changed the method used by the core code to report
		  errors.

		  Previously when something went wrong, an error message was
		  printed to stderr. However with the gtk interface this would
		  never be seen and with the ncurses interface it messed up the
		  screen.

		  Now the error message is placed in the global variable char*
		  errmsg. Then the interface (ncurses / gtk) can display it in the
		  appropriate way (in the footer area or in a pop up dialog).

		  I also created a new function for the ncurses interface:
		  nci_press_any_key.  It takes a message which it prints to the
		  footer area followed by "Press any key to continue." and waits
		  for a key press before returning. The ncurses interface now uses
		  this with errmsg to tell the user what went if the core code
		  returns an error code.

			  John

	2004-04-10 17:47  thestarz

		* src/ncurses_ui.c: Fixed a bug in the code for getting text from
		  the user using the footer area. Previously it would segfault if
		  you enlarged your terminal after getting to that prompt and then
		  typing a lot of text into it.

			  John

	2004-04-10 15:40  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c: Page up and page down now scroll the list
		  of entries up or down one page.

			  John

	2004-04-09 19:12  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Added the following
		  global key strokes for the ncurses interface:

			  Insert - Add an entry
			  Delete - Delete an entry
			  Home - Select first entry
			  End - Select last entry

		  Page up and page down need to be done as well now.

			  John

	2004-04-09 16:01  thestarz

		* TODO, src/gtk_ui_main.c, src/main.c, src/main.h,
		  src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Implemented Joe's suggestion
		  and made the function for viewing entries into a generic function
		  for viewing arbitrary text. Now help->about can use it for the
		  about message as well.

		  Straightened out the key bindings for the gtk interface so that
		  we no longer conflict with select all. I can't seem to find a
		  stock item for help->about, though I've seen other apps use it.

		  The about message is now stored in a global variable, instead of
		  a #define so that it's not duplicated in each file that uses it.
		  CIRE_ABOUT_MESSAGE is now #defineD to point to the new variable.

			  John

	2004-04-07 11:12  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Key strokes that are
		  valid in all menus are now handled by nci_global_key_handler()
		  rather than having duplicate caseS call over the place.

			  John

	2004-04-06 21:07  deadalien

		* src/text_ui.c: fixed build warnings

	2004-04-06 18:51  thestarz

		* build.pl: Added uninstall to the build script. Also added
		  --prefix=foo to specify the installation prefix.

			  John

	2004-04-05 17:34  thestarz

		* TODO, src/diary.c, src/diary.h, src/entry.c, src/entry.h,
		  src/misc.c, src/misc.h, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h:
		  Search support. You can now search by either title or contents
		  using the ncurses interface. Gtk support needs to be done now;
		  any volunteers?

			  John

	2004-04-04 15:25  thestarz

		* src/: ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Changed the ncurses interface
		  to use the new html export code, with header and footer support.

			  John

	2004-04-03 16:35  thestarz

		* src/: diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h,
		  gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.h: Added the patch
		  from Tom Davis and made a few change to it.

		  Thanks, Tom. :-)

			  John

	2004-04-03 14:42  deadalien

		* src/prefs.c: Added end-slash checking for cire_dir

	2004-04-03 14:14  joeabbey

		* src/ncurses_ui.c: Resolved Random Floating Point error issue.

		  joe

	2004-04-03 13:15  deadalien

		* src/prefs.c:
		  I added the parsing routines to detect ~ in prefs

	2004-04-03 12:52  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c: The header now indicates what sorting
		  method is being used.

			  John

	2004-04-03 12:03  thestarz

		* build.pl, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Made some changes
		  to Joe's ncurses prefs code. The main one being that the elements
		  / widgets used are no longer global.

			  John

	2004-04-03 02:27  joeabbey

		* src/ncurses_ui.c: Great.. I can't sleep.

		  As I was trying to doze off, I was thinking about the code.. yeah
		  sick?  Anyway realized that I wasn't finding the correct position
		  when viewing.. I fixed it.  Should work better/fine now.

		  Joe

	2004-04-03 01:33  joeabbey

		* TODO: Whoops.. forgot to close emacs.. here's my changes to TODO.

		  It's basically removed Tools-Preferences, and suggested that we
		  change the function view, so that it's more useful.. or at least
		  break it apart so we can use it to scroll the about message, or
		  even have online documentation.

	2004-04-03 01:28  joeabbey

		* build.pl, src/main.h, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h,
		  src/prefs.c, src/prefs.h: Lots of changes:

		  I'll try to list them all.

		  Prefs: Ian, I apologize about changing prefs, but I can
		  guarantee, I affected you code in no way, in fact I made it
		  better.  Previously your enum was in the .c file. So only your
		  source could access the enum.  I moved it to the .h file and this
		  caused no conflicts.

		  Main.h: With -Wall the compiler was griping about the close
		  function being an implicit declaration.  So I #included
		  <unistd.h> in main.h.  This cleared up this warning.

		  Build.pl: I didn't like how $cc had become gcc -Wall, so I added
		  $opts and also included -O3, this should add some more warnings,
		  but are pretty quick to clear up.  For example int the nci_sort
		  function it was griping about timestamp not being intialized.  So
		  the declaration is now int timestamp=0;

		  Ncurses: Added a struct called options that contains a name,
		  which is used to named the stored value "buffer", and index is
		  the strlen(buffer).

		  This should make it easy to add preferences in the future, as
		  they are accessible by an array.  Just walk through with a for
		  loop.

		  Added functions to take care of the creating and destroying of
		  the options struct.

		  Added nci_tools_prefs, this takes care of the assigning/editing
		  of preference sduring runtime.  Any suggestions to optimize this
		  would be appreciated, as well as any style issues.

		  An issue I found was that ESC (at least in my terminal) takes
		  about a sec to parse, but F1 and most other keys are nearly
		  instantaneous.  Noticed this multiple times.	ESC in any menu
		  takes a bit.	I dunno if we're using the wrong #define, or what
		  but we should really try to find out.

		  Changed the footer of entry_view. To the following:

		  Line x of total - Percent%

		  If there were any other changes I made.. I can't think of them.

		  So I'll be looking forward to the new additions/mods soon!

		  Good night!

		  Joe

	2004-04-02 12:25  thestarz

		* src/: diary.c, diary.h, entry.c, entry.h: Did some work on search
		  support in the diary and entry modules. Look at my comments (and
		  code) to see what I did.

			  John

	2004-04-02 11:13  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Added sort support to
		  the ncurses interface. I'd like to have the header (top line)
		  indicate how the diary is being sorted. Any thoughts on how it
		  should look?

			  John

	2004-04-02 08:25  joeabbey

		* src/: diary.c, diary.h: No changes to misc.h.. oops.. I put the
		  search_by_title function in there first and realized it was out
		  of place.  I've not tested it yet but it's pretty simple so if it
		  requires any editing, please feel free.

		  Basically it works like this:

		  Me: I want to search for ab,

		  Cire: program calls Cire: diary_search_by_title(diary, "ab", 0)
		  Cire: returns first occurence.

		  Me: I will tell my ui no thats not it

		  Cire: diary_search_by_title(diary, "ab", occurence++)

		  This will also resolve the issue with sorting in Ncurses.  Here's
		  the basic algorithm I was considering:

		  sort search for previously pointed to update

		  Easy enough eh?

		  Now we can also add searching to our toolkit of toys!

		  Anywho, I'll try to start integrating it, if someone hasn't by
		  the time I'm done at work today.

		  Joe

	2004-04-01 19:48  thestarz

		* build.pl, src/diary.c, src/gtk_ui_main.c, src/ncurses_ui.c:
		  Changed the build script to use -Wall and fixed a couple of the
		  warnings it gave.

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c: The ncurses ui now displays entries
		  itself instead of using less.

		  *** John

	2004-04-01 11:38  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Improved
		  nci_update_screen() a bit. It now truncates large entry titles.

		  *** John

	2004-03-31 19:25  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Fixed
		  nci_get_user_text() so that backspace works when used in an
		  aterm.  Also fixed it so that it doesn't fuck up when you resize
		  said term.

		  *** John

	2004-03-31 18:30  joeabbey

		* src/ncurses_ui.h: Didn't need these anymore..

		  Instead using the ncurses defines for keys..

	2004-03-31 18:22  joeabbey

		* TODO: Sorting should be handled by the core files not by the
		  uis.. then the diary that is accessed will reflect the sorted
		  changes

	2004-03-31 18:20  joeabbey

		* src/: ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Now get user text allows for
		  deletion..

	2004-03-31 17:52  joeabbey

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Scrolling now works
		  like typical scrollers do.

		  Enjoy

	2004-03-31 17:22  joeabbey

		* src/ncurses_ui.c: Added basic scrolling for the ui.. hope to make
		  it better next commit

	2004-03-31 15:21  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Added export support to
		  ncurses.

		  *** John

	2004-03-31 14:37  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: You can now specify a
		  filename on the commandline for ncurses to use, eg: $ cire -n
		  foobar.cire

		  *** John

	2004-03-31 11:55  thestarz

		* TODO, src/misc.c, src/ncurses_ui.c: The ncurses ui now knows
		  about the ~ character and it forces .cire unless the filename
		  without the .cire already exists.

		  Also fixed misc_interpolate_filename().

		  *** John

	2004-03-30 18:47  thestarz

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Implemented
		  help->about.

		  Also changed it so that stuff on the bottum lines is always
		  indented two spaces just like the top line.

		  *** John

	2004-03-30 13:59  joeabbey

		* TODO, build.pl, src/main.h, src/misc.c, src/misc.h,
		  src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Applied John's patch

		  Looked fine to me..

		  Unfortunately though, this means all of my work is for naught.

		  I suppose I'll still try to submit updates for the ui using the
		  new design or perhaps work on a more robust encryption scheme..

		  Anyway the code is cleaner and more robust

		  joe

	2004-03-28 14:41  joeabbey

		* TODO, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Some nice changes:

		  Fixed my .emacs so that it goes tabstop to tabstop inserting tabs
		  now and not spaces.  I still have to do some work to get this
		  perfect, but now the display of the code should be editor
		  dependent and not the way I had it looking.  So yay tabs.

		  Did some tweaking, Created a new function called wipe that clears
		  the cire area.  Getting closer to a 1.0 release here.  Just need
		  to enable the Tools menu.. really to allow for this.	Then
		  subsequent changes/bug testing should be included in 1.x.x
		  releases.

		  Still need alot of beautification of my code.  Its dirty but it
		  does its job.. if you don't try anything extreme/out of the
		  ordinary.

		  Also, My buffer overflow protection doesn't allow users active
		  feedback... so I'd suggest we change it to John's beeping
		  config.. I'll have to try to get that back in there.	Or maybe he
		  can :)

		  Alrighty thats about it for now...

		  Joe

	2004-03-27 17:04  joeabbey

		* src/ncurses_ui.c: After MUCH head banging.. discovered the
		  fundamental difference between file descriptors and FILE streams.
		   Ah, learning is fun.

		  closing the fd that mkstemp creates prevents possible problems.
		  If I ever get around to writing a cire ncurses viewer.. we'll get
		  to change this in some cases.

		  Anyway.. a great example at what RTFMing can do for YOU

		  joe

	2004-03-27 15:21  joeabbey

		* src/: ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Applied another one of John's
		  patches

		  Made some modification.  Didn't like the temp file being
		  generated from the title of the entry.. Since users like to put
		  spaces in their titles (I did) attempting to open them without
		  escaping the spaces will cause fireworks for some systems.  It
		  created the file easy enough but opening it didn't seem to work.

		  Instead I'm using mkstemp :-) with the template of
		  /tmp/cire-XXXXXX.  This provides a unique file and "guarantees"
		  it will open a new file!

		  Enjoy.  I'm getting the programming bug again so I should be back
		  and committing more often than biweekly.. we'll see.

		  Laters Joe

	2004-03-27 14:50  thestarz

		* src/: misc.c, misc.h: Added a function in misc.c to turn a
		  filename containing a ~ into an absolute filename.

		  *** John

	2004-03-26 12:17  thestarz

		* src/: gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  gtk_ui_main.h: Commiting Ian's patch to make Cire's gtk ui use
		  stock icons and the gtk item factory. Thanks, Ian!

		  ~ john

	2004-03-25 20:53  joeabbey

		* src/: ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: A basic fix... Now upon
		  entering Cire.. Untitled IS printed.. and opening or saving as
		  updates the header and footer

		  Yay, I finally posted a commit again

	2004-03-25 12:47  thestarz

		* build.pl, src/ncurses_ui.c, src/ncurses_ui.h: Joe has given me
		  permission to commit the work I've done on ncurses, so here it
		  is.

		  Cire can now be built with the ncurses ui enabled again. :-)

Cire Version 0.13.0:

	2004-03-21 15:51  andrewm1

		* CHANGES, HACKING, INSTALL, README, main.h:

		  0.13: Released! I used the cvs2cl.pl script to create a New

		* TODO, diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  main.h, misc.c, misc.h, text_ui.c: Ok, here's the new crypt code.
		  See my last email to the list for more info.

		  NOTE: Ian has given me permission to modify text_ui.c

		  ~john

	2004-03-20 16:34  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h: The gtk interface
		  can now be given a filename on the command line to open, eg: cire
		  foobar.cire

		  Ian: I changed prefs_save_to_file() to prefs_save() in the gtk
		  code so you can remove your backwards-compatability-#define now.

		  ~john

	2004-03-20 11:47  thestarz

		* TODO, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c:
		  Right clicking on an entry now gives you a popup menu with 'Add',
		  'Delete' and 'Rename'.

		  ~john

	2004-03-19 20:27  thestarz

		* misc.h, misc.c: Added function to copy one string into another
		  string, since it seems to be something we do a lot. ;-)

		  ~john

	2004-03-18 12:50  thestarz

		* TODO, gtk_ui_callbacks.c: You can now specify a password in the
		  save as dialog in the gtk ui.

		  ~john

	2004-03-17 19:17  deadalien

		* text_ui.c: Applied tac's quitting patch.

	2004-03-14 14:49  deadalien

		* prefs.c, prefs.h, text_ui.c:
		  added 'const char * prefs_get_argv_file()' text_ui can now use it
		  to open a file on the command line

		  e.g.: ./cire -t ~/doc/my_diary

	2004-03-14 13:09  thestarz

		* TODO, diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h,
		  gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h, misc.c, misc.h: The gtk ui now
		  asks before overwriting a file both for ordinary save-as and for
		  when you do an export. Also it only adds an extension to the
		  filename if the filename without the extension does not exist,
		  otherwise it leaves it with no extension.

		  The export functions in diary no longer add a file extension.
		  This is so the user can save over an existing file that doesn't
		  have an extension.  See above.

		  ~john

	2004-03-13 20:53  thestarz

		* misc.c, misc.h: Added function misc_file_exists() to determine if
		  a file exists. Will be used to prompt the user before overwriting
		  an existing file by the gtk user interface.

		  ~john

	2004-03-13 18:42  thestarz

		* text_ui.c: oops...

	2004-03-12 18:18  deadalien

		* text_ui.c:
		  regarding "TAC()"s email about an entry pointer that still
		  pointed to a deleted entry, i fixed it.

		  he/she/it proposed setting it to the first entry, whereas i
		  simply set both the pointer and the offset to the values they're
		  at when an entry has not been selected.

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c,
		  gtk_ui_other.h: Added to the gtk ui the ability to open an
		  encrypted diary and save it again.  Saving a new file or saving
		  an old one under a new name using encryption is not implemented
		  yet.

	2004-03-11 13:38  thestarz

		* build.pl, diary.c, diary.h: Added a function to determine whether
		  a file is encrypted. UIs should use this to know whether they
		  should prompt for a password when opening a file.

		  Improved the build script. It should know correctly determine
		  which files should be recompiled.

	2004-03-10 23:21  deadalien

		* build.pl, text_ui.c: diary_save_to_file code changed, uses NULL
		  for key

	2004-03-10 12:33  thestarz

		* build.pl, diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, misc.h: I've done
		  some more work on encryption support. Unfortunately I've had to
		  modify another function signature. :-( This time it's
		  diary_save_to_file(), it now takes a *key as well.

		  This should be the last signature change however, and (assuming I
		  didn't make any mistakes) core support for encryption is now
		  complete. Once the interfaces have been updated to use it we'll
		  be able to encrypt diaries! :-)

		  Just like last time I've commented Ian and Joe's interfaces out
		  of the build script, once you guys have updated your code, remove
		  the comments. Same lines as last time.

		* text_ui.c: stopped pointlessly trying to free an entry

	2004-03-09 20:58  deadalien

		* text_ui.c:
		  free the PROMPT string on cleanup, in case it's what was causing
		  john's error.

	2004-03-09 20:38  deadalien

		* build.pl, text_ui.c: Incorporated john's changes

	2004-03-09 20:31  thestarz

		* build.pl, diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, misc.c, misc.h:
		  I've done some more work on encryption support. Unfortunately
		  I've had to change the signature of diary_load_from_file(). It is
		  now:

		  int diary_load_from_file(struct diary* obj, const char* file,
		  const char* key); /* This loads the diary stored in *file into
		  the specified file  * into *obj, replacing the current contents.
		  If key is non-null  * the file's contents are unencrypted using
		  *key before being  * parsed. Returns 0 on success.  */

		  This breaks the text and ncurses interfaces. I've changed the
		  build script to leave them out until Joe and Ian can update their
		  code.

		  Joe: Once you've updated your code please uncomment lines 123 and
		  192.	Ian: Once you've updated your code please uncomment line
		  193.

		  Interface code should pass NULL for the key until encryption
		  support is done.

	2004-03-07 11:14  thestarz

		* TODO, build.pl, diary.c, diary.h, main.h, misc.c, misc.h: Created
		  misc.[c,h] to hold functions that aren't tied to any module.

		  Moved the functions for removing newlines from a string, from
		  diary.* to misc.*

		  Added the function misc_crypt() to misc.* it will encrypt/decript
		  a given section of memory with a given key, by XORing the data
		  with the key. Thanks to Joe, for helping me come up with this
		  encryption method.

		  All of this is geared towards adding support for encrypted
		  diaries.

	2004-03-06 18:37  thestarz

		* TODO, diary.c, diary.h: The diary module now keeps track of the
		  number of entries it contains, instead of counting them each time
		  diary_get_entry_count() is called.

		  Thanks to Joe, for suggesting this change.

	2004-03-04 23:55  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c: Just a little addition..  needed to kill /tmp/.cire
		  upon entry.. in case there was a stray one

	2004-03-04 23:47  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Alrighty...

		  Added functions:

		  New Diary Save As Edit Delete Rename

		  Known Issues

		  Currently (for whatever reason) the first time I attempt to edit
		  an entry I get garbage characters.. If I delete them and then
		  attempt to re edit the same entry.  They do not reapper.  I'm
		  afraid this will cause segfaults for you guys.  I'm actively
		  pursuing this bug.

		  Case handling is currently poor.  IE, what if you try to edit
		  before you've opened a diary.  Or, what if you try to save before
		  opening a diary.  I'm pretty sure both of these cases will cause
		  the program to die.  I will get them fixed so just gimme a bit to
		  fix them.

		  About is still no clearing.  I'm gonna try to fix that too ASAP.

		  TODO	  Better Case handling	  Fix About	  Integrate
		  preferences	Create a Preferences form.. yeesh	and much
		  much more!

		  For the most part its a working ui.  It still has limited
		  functionality and it isn't terribly smart.  So work with me.

		  Enjoy!

	2004-03-04 22:11  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Made more changes

		  you can save!

		  you can add entries!

		* TODO, text_ui.c, text_ui.h:
		  added the #ifdefs

		  made a note that joe's ncurses ui already takes care of asking
		  the user to open a file.

	2004-03-02 11:04  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Added ifdefs for new build model

	2004-03-02 10:06  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: !!!!!Major Overhaul of code...!!!!!

		  ABSTRACT:

		  The ncurses_ui which is now known henceforth as nci, was straying
		  too far from the gtk look and feel.  This was my first attempt at
		  ncurses programming.. so a redesign was definitely in order.
		  Many of the functions I had created are still useful and I
		  haven't yet removed/modified them.  But give the nci a look, I
		  hope the changes are satifactory.  Let me know if it .. you know
		  segfaults right off the bat ;P

		  CHANGES/ADDITIONS:

		  New main menu    Diary Entry Help Quit

	    	 New Diary submenu
			 New Open Save Quit

	    	 New Entry submenu
			 Add Edit View Delete Rename

	    	 New Help sub menu
			 About

		  Currently user can only open diary and display help.

		  Have builtin (rudimentary) buffer overflow support.  If the
		  filename the user enters is longer than 80 chars.. the program
		  punts and asks for a valid file name.  Right now it just loops
		  forever until a filename less than 80 chars is inputted

		  New struct.

		  struct nci

		  This was needed because I found that the only way to break this
		  program apart was to be sending a MENU, ITEM, WINDOW, diary, and
		  other variables in each function.  Decided that lonnnnng
		  functions weren't pretty.  Made a struct and now I pass it.
		  Hopefully it won't make the nci code tooo difficult to
		  understand.  Currently using one nci struct.. declared it
		  statically.  Created a nci_new() function in case anyone wanted
		  to use it dynamically.

		  Many function prototypes have changed with the overhaul.

		  Considering adding a couple #defines for footer and header
		  messages... browse the code you'll see.. if you don't look for:
		  DIARY OPTIONS - [N]ew [O]pen [S]ave [Q]uit

		  More work to follow, like more functionality.

	2004-03-01 12:46  thestarz

		* TODO, build.pl: I've fixed the build script to rebuild if any of
		  the headers have been modified.

		  I've also added the params '-h', '--help' and '-help' to do the
		  same as 'help'.  Should be more user friendly now.

	2004-03-01 09:42  thestarz

		* TODO, build.pl, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h,
		  gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h,
		  main.c, main.h: I've added the #ifdefS for configurable building
		  to main* and gtk_ui*. You can now use the --without-gtk-ui arg on
		  build.pl to leave out gtk. Once Ian adds #ifdefS to text_ui* and
		  Joe adds them to ncurses_ui* we'll be all set.

		  PS. It builds FAST without gtk. ;-)

	2004-02-29 15:53  thestarz

		* diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h,
		  gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h: Added diary_export_html() to the
		  diary module. It exports the diary to a file in html. Right now
		  it generates rather a rather ugly web page. Andrew, since your
		  our html expert, maybe you could create an example of how an
		  exported diary should look in html, for me to go on?

		  Changed the gtk interface to be able to use the new export code.
		  I've created a tools menu with a sub-menu called export. It will
		  ultimatly have a button for every format we can export to. Right
		  now that's just html. I also moved the preferences button to the
		  new tools menu.

		  NOTE: The diary_export_html() method (and probably any future
		  export methods) use prefs_get_timef() to know how to format
		  timestamps. It's important that any ui's that want to call it
		  first initialize the prefs module with prefs_init().

	2004-02-29 12:15  thestarz

		* diary.c, diary.h, entry.c, entry.h: Automagically reformated
		  indenting in the diary and entry files to use only tabs, instead
		  of a random mix of tabs and spaces. This was long overdue.

		  Changed 'char*' to 'const char*' where appropriate in the diary
		  and entry files. This introduces some warnings in other parts of
		  cire that will need to be resolved, but they don't break
		  anything.

		  Removed the backwards compatability #defineS for
		  diary_get_title() and diary_set_title(). They were no longer
		  nessessary.

	2004-02-29 10:42  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c: Added a menu
		  separator bar above and below 'preferences'.	Entry titles longer
		  than 20 characters are now truncated, with '...' appended before
		  they are displayed in the tree view.

	2004-02-28 19:01  deadalien

		* prefs.c, prefs.h:
		  prefs_set_whatever(char * string); is now:

		  prefs_set_whatever(const char * string);

		  this fixes the annoying compilation warnings.

	2004-02-28 18:21  deadalien

		* prefs.c, prefs.h:
		  prefs_save_to_file is now prefs_save(); it remains #define'd in
		  prefs.h until any ui code has been resolved

		  put a warning in ~/.cirerc about it being overwritten on
		  prefs_save()

		  started checking for which preferences actually need to be saved
		  to the file, e.g. a pref gotten from env needn't / shouldn't be
		  written to file, so it isn't.

	2004-02-28 16:35  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h: You can now change the width of the
		  tree view containing the list of entries.

	2004-02-27 21:00  deadalien

		* prefs.c: made a typo in the last commit, damnit

	2004-02-27 20:56  deadalien

		* prefs.c:
		  fixed the bug(s) john pointed out (applied his patch).  Sorry
		  about that guys :)  I did that fix in sort of a hurry.

	2004-02-27 16:32  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c: Well here's a small addition.  Ncurses now employs
		  the time function, at least for the menu.

		  Look for more updates in the near future.  Gonna try to get that
		  file stuff that you guys have agreed on.  (file stuffs = asking
		  user to open the diary)

		  Also did some cosmetics.  Now regardless of how much large the
		  terminal is than 80x24 the header and footer extends.

		  Let me know of any segfaults

Cire Version 0.12.0:

		* prefs.c: cire_dirt defaults to /home/ian/ instead of just
		  /home/ian, for gtk

	2004-02-25 18:39  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_main.c: Added mnemonic support to the gtk interface.

	2004-02-25 16:01  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_main.c: Set the prefs window to be modal and to be a child
		  of the main window.

	2004-02-25 15:27  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h: Added code to the
		  gtk interface to use Ian's prefs module.

		  IAN: Can you change the default cire_dir from "/home/foobar" to
		  /home/foobar/"? Without the trailing slash the gtk file selection
		  dialog puts you in /home instead of in /home/foobar.

	2004-02-25 12:26  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_main.c: The text view used to edit entries now word-wraps.

	2004-02-23 18:30  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_other.c,
		  gtk_ui_other.h: Fixed the gtk interface so that when you add /
		  modify and entry the diary is resorted so that it goes to it's
		  proper place.

	2004-02-23 12:00  thestarz

		* diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h,
		  gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h:
		  Added a sort method to the diary module. Added code to the gtk
		  interface to sort using the new code in diary.  Sorting by
		  timestamp works fine, however there seems to be something wrong
		  with sorting by title.

	2004-02-22 14:09  deadalien

		* text_ui.c:
		  little changes.  Can now show selected entry's timestamp Better
		  'select' dialog Cleaned up the exit prompts Don't ask to save
		  unless the diary has been edited (hopefully)

	2004-02-22 13:58  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_other.c,
		  gtk_ui_other.h: Implemented entry->rename.

	2004-02-22 11:00  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  gtk_ui_main.h: Implemented entry->remove and the 'save entry'
		  button. The gtk interface is now usable! :-)

	2004-02-21 22:42  andrewm1

		* HACKING:

		  Changed FIleship Management List to be Listed in alphabetical
		  order.

	2004-02-21 21:18  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h: Now, when you click on an entry
		  in the tree view, it's contents are put into the text view on the
		  right.

	2004-02-21 19:51  andrewm1

		* COPYING, HACKING, README:

		  Added File HACKING with info about Contributing, Removed File
		  Management List from COPYING and placed it into HACKING, Changed
		  Section 6 of README to "6: Contributors and Contributing" and
		  Referenced HACKING from there.

	2004-02-21 16:48  andrewm1

		* prefs.c, prefs.h: Minor fixes that john pointed out

	2004-02-21 10:43  thestarz

		* diary.c, diary.h: Proper newline (\n) fix. Instead of simply
		  ignoring all newlines in the diary file it does the following:

		  All newlines are removed from titles.  All newlines are removed
		  from timestamps.  The first and last newlines (if found) are
		  removed from the contents of entries, leaving ones added by the
		  user for formatting purposes.

Cire Version 0.11.0:

	2004-02-20 23:25  andrewm1

		* COPYING: Added Clause with Contact Details

	2004-02-20 23:25  andrewm1

	2004-02-20 23:20  andrewm1

		* CHANGES, README:

			  Version 0.11.0:
				  -John made many Improvements to the Diary code.
				  -John also made many improvements to the GTK
		  interface.

	2004-02-20 23:17  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c: Fixed bug if $EDITOR hadn't been set.. oops

		  I've got many more to find and fix

	2004-02-20 23:00  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: With the recent debug of the core
		  files I was able to get some constant results.  Good news:

			  You can read and write diary entries via ncurses ui!

		  TODO:   Add timestamp support, right now all I have is Timestamp
		  in the location	 where the appropriate timestamp should be

			  Make About message scrollable?  Currently it is too large
		  to fit in the
			  viewable area.. unless you make your terminal bigger than
		  80x24

			  Integrate preferences.

			  Consider Sorting.  Should we have functions in the diary
		  module that do	 sorting or should each ui concern itself
		  with sorting.

			  Clean up.  The code works but its messy.. again.  time to
		  do some
			  cleanup

			  Bed.	Its late.  I have the whole weekend ahead of me.

			  Enjoy the udpates!

	2004-02-20 18:21  deadalien

		* text_ui.c, text_ui.h:
		  Text ui has andrew's prompt patch, and the ability to view an
		  entry.  It looks like crap though because John strips all the
		  newlines out of the file :)  (I'm not sure who's end to resolve
		  that on yet)

		  Ian.

	2004-02-20 15:35  thestarz

		* diary.c: Added code to read the timestamps from the file when you
		  call diary_load_from_file().	Added code to save the timestamps
		  to the file when you call diary_save_to_file().

	2004-02-20 10:27  deadalien

		* prefs.c: I fixed a bug John pointed out where I was possibly
		  doing a bad strncpy.

	2004-02-20 09:54  thestarz

		* diary.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h: Implemented
		  entry->add.

		  I fixed the bug that adds junk to the end of titles and contents
		  of entries. It was in diary_load_from_file(). I was thinking that
		  strncpy worked like strcpy and put a NULL after the stuff it
		  copied. Upon closer inspection of the man page I discovered this:

		  "The	strncpy()  function  is  similar,  except that not more
		  than n bytes of src are copied. Thus, if there is no null byte
		  among the first n bytes of src, the result will not be
		  null-terminated."

		  All I had to do was manually add the terminating NULL and the bug
		  went away. :-)

	2004-02-19 22:25  deadalien

		* text_ui.c, text_ui.h:
		  Andrew added an About dialog using John's CIRE_ABOUT_MSG

		  \m/

	2004-02-19 21:04  deadalien

		* text_ui.c:
		  OK, (sort of) new text ui.  I re-did the menu and added some
		  status info so it's more "user-friendly."

		  It still has bugs, but since i'm not fixing them at a super-man
		  like rate, I figured I'd let you guys feed on this while i keep
		  fixing/improving shit.

		  Some things on my todo list are: - add a prefs dialog - allow
		  user to view entry - try to figure out the garbage in entry
		  titles - various fixes/ cleanups

	2004-02-19 20:08  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.c,
		  gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c, gtk_ui_other.h, main.h:
		  Implemented diary->new.  Improvements to diary->open, diary->save
		  and diary->save as.  Got rid of diary->close. New does basically
		  the same thing.  Instead of asking if you really want to quit, it
		  asks if you want to save first.  All of the diary menu is now
		  implemented! :-)

	2004-02-19 19:12  deadalien

		* prefs.c:
		  fixed a problem where the pref would get set to the entire line
		  in a file, instead of just the value in said file.

	2004-02-19 17:31  andrewm1

		* README: Changed Debugging Process to a much easier way the Does
		  NOT involve editing the Makefile.

	2004-02-19 17:28  andrewm1

		* main.h: Changed About Message

		* diary.c: Fixed a minor typo...

	2004-02-19 15:51  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h: Implemented diary->save
		  and diary->save as.

	2004-02-19 13:59  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_main.c, gtk_ui_main.h, gtk_ui_other.c,
		  gtk_ui_other.h: I've implemented the diary->open callback. You
		  can now open a diary file and see the entries listed in the
		  GtkTreeView.	I also added a function to popup an error dialog
		  with a specifiable error message.

	2004-02-18 14:51  thestarz

		* diary.c, diary.h, entry.h, main.h: Diary objects no longer have
		  titles. UIs may need to be updated accordingly, however I have
		  created diary_set_title() and diary_get_title() as macros for the
		  time being, so nothing will be broken by this.  I've #defineD
		  CIRE_VERSION as "0.10.0" in main.h. Andrew will need to update
		  this whenever he makes a release.  I've modified the format for
		  diary files slightly. They no longer begin with <cire-diary> and
		  end with </cire-diary>. These were unneccesary and, indeed, werer
		  ignored by the diary parsing code anyway. Instead diary files
		  will begin with: "This is a Cire diary file. It was created by
		  Cire vn.n.n", however the diary parsing code will not require
		  this to be present. It's strictly optional, and only there for
		  the benefit of human readers.  I've also gone over the diary code
		  and fixed some things. Hopefully the UI programmers won't have
		  anymore problems with it. ;-)

Cire Version 0.10.0:

		* COPYING, prefs.c, prefs.h, text_ui.c, text_ui.h:

		  Officially Gave OwnerShip on the Text UI files to Ian. Also Fixed
		  Ownership for Prefs Files.

	2004-02-17 17:44  thestarz

		* diary.c: Fixed diary_free(). It no longer segfaults.

	2004-02-17 17:31  deadalien

		* text_ui.c: fixes segfault on New

	2004-02-17 17:20  deadalien

		* Makefile, main.c, main.h, text_ui.c, text_ui.h: adding text_ui

	2004-02-17 16:48  thestarz

		* diary.c, diary.h, gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_other.c,
		  gtk_ui_other.h: I've added a function to the diary modules to see
		  if the diary is empty or not.

		  I've changed confirm_quit() to ask_question_via_dialog(). It now
		  asks a specifiable question instead of always asking the same
		  thing, thus making it more reusable.

		  I've added a function to ask the user for a filename using a
		  GtkFileSelection dialog. This will eventually be used by
		  diary->open and diary->save as.

	2004-02-17 16:05  deadalien

		* prefs.c, prefs.h:
		  Total Prefs rewrite.

		  Supported Preferences:     char * editor;	 to edit with
		  char * cire_dir;    dir to save diaries in	 char * timef;
		   user's preferred time display format

		  See the bottom of prefs.h for the set/get function calls and how
		  to use them.

		  Basic Usage:	   In your initialization steps, call:
		  prefs_init(argc, argv);     Then call your set/gets as you need.
	    	  To cleanup just call: prefs_free();

	    	  Email me with any questions :)

	2004-02-17 13:01  thestarz

		* gtk_ui_callbacks.c, gtk_ui_callbacks.h, gtk_ui_main.h, main.h:
		  I've #defined CIRE_ABOUT_MESSAGE in main.h to be a string
		  containing an about message for cire. I've added code to the gtk
		  interface to open an about dialog containing this message when
		  you click on help->about.

	2004-02-17 00:40  andrewm1

		* Makefile:

		  Default For Makefile should be Debugging OFF.

	2004-02-17 00:38  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c: shouldn't segfault immediately for users

		  TODO	  -if diary title is NULL set it to something	     to
		  prevent segfaults

	2004-02-17 00:11  andrewm1

		* Makefile, README:

		  My Original Way to allow debugging didn't work, so I just added a
		  bunch of comments to the Makefile about how to enable Debugging
		  mode by Changing the CC Variable, and noted it in the readme.
		  Only Developers should be Debugging anyways...

	2004-02-16 23:58  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c: minor tweaks

	2004-02-16 23:25  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: About now works properly Also now we
		  have persistent data! If you add an entry it remains next time
		  you open!

		  TODO: 	  -READ DIARY!	  -entry management?
		  -implement Preferences  -implement Sorting	  -timestamps

	2004-02-16 22:58  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c: Write works! as long as your title is fewer than 80
		  characters

		   TODO:
			  -Need to do error checking with that
			  -Find a way to READ entries

	2004-02-16 22:38  andrewm1

		* Makefile, README:

		  Changed Makefile to Enable Easy Debugging (make -DDEBUG_MODE).
		  Added it to the Tips and Tricks Section of the README.

	2004-02-16 20:22  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.c, ncurses_ui.h: Changes	 -compiles now TODO
		  -segfaults left and right    -get it to work

	2004-02-16 19:56  joeabbey

		* ncurses_ui.h: Testing ncurses_ui.h unfortunately this will cause
		  compile errors.. I should have this fixed prior to anyone
		  checking out the newest verions.  Or at least I hope.

		  Cheers!
